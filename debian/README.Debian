incron for Debian
-----------------

 By default users are not allowed to use incron. To allow or deny some users,
 take a look at the information related to /etc/incron.allow and
 /etc/incron.deny in incrond(8) manpage.

 Users are not allowed to use incron by default because a bad usage of incron
 with (loops) can make the whole system hanging. See BUGS section in incrond(8)
 manpage. Be careful with users allowed to use incron.

 Systems incrontabs goes to /etc/incron.d .
